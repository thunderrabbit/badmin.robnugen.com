Hey future Rob

I was thinking  about writing an easy CGI script to allow renaming of imagesif I can see the thumbnails.

Like array of thumbnails and can change the image names if I like.  Name changes would be reflected on disk.

Instead of starting from scratch, I will try the code at https://github.com/samayo/bulletproof

Hey Future Rob

I hope I can call this via BASH scripts when I upload images, e.g. from my local machine ~/mt3.com/upparts.sh

Today I uploaded a file to
https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/track/parts/2022/2022_apr_05_doctor_sugar_holding_zog_rails_support.jpg
and it showed up sideways.  Ughh.
